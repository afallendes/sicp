# Exercise 1.9

Each of the following two procedures defines a method for adding two positive
integers in terms of the procedures `inc`, which increments its argument by 1,
and `dec`, which decrements its argument by 1.

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0) b (inc (+ (dec a) b))))
```

```scheme
(define (+ a b)
    (if (= a 0) b (+ (dec a) (inc b))))
```

Using the substitution model, illustrate the process generated by each procedure in evaluating `(+ 4 5)`. Are these processes iterative or recursive?

## Answer

The first process is recursive because it expands and then shrinks by its own definition while it evolves:

```scheme
> (+ 4 5)
. (inc (+ (dec 4) 5))
. (inc (+ 3 5))
. (inc (inc (+ (dec 3) 5)))
. (inc (inc (+ 2 5)))
. (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 2) 5))))
. (inc (inc (inc (+ 1 5))))
. (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ (dec 1) 5)))))
. (inc (inc (inc (inc (+ 0 5)))))
. (inc (inc (inc (inc 5))))
. (inc (inc (inc 6)))
. (inc (inc 7))
. (inc 8)
> 9
```

The second process is iterative because at any point the process can be stop and continued just by providing the required parameters:

```scheme
> (+ 4 5)
. (+ (dec 4) (inc 5))
. (+ 3 6)
. (+ (dec 3) (inc 6))
. (+ 2 7)
. (+ (dec 2) (inc 7))
. (+ 1 8)
. (+ (dec 2) (inc 8))
. (+ 0 9)
> 9
```
