# Exercise 1.8

Newton's method for cube roots is based on the fact that if `y` is an
approximation to the cube root of `x`, then a better approximation is given
by the value:

![equation](https://latex.codecogs.com/svg.image?\bg_white&space;\frac{\frac{x}{y^{2}}&space;&plus;&space;2y}{3})

Use this formula to implement a `cube-root` procedure analogous to the
`square-root` procedure. (In Section 1.3.4 we will see how to implement
Newtonâ€™s method in general as an abstraction of these `square-root` and
`cube-root` procedures.)
